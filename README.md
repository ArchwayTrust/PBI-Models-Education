# PBI Models - Education

## Getting Started
Model is serialised into [Microsoft TMDL format](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-public-preview-of-the-tabular-model-definition-language-tmdl/).
This is human readable text but can also be opened by newer version of Tabular Editor 2 if the preview feature is enabled:
[Tabular Editor 2.x Releases](https://github.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/releases).

## Contributing
Once TMDL is out of preview and can serialise role membership we will look to enable contributions via pull requests.
